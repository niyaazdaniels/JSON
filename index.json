I have a keen interest in learning coding, a burning passion to create and to provide. I enjoy helping everyone. I am fueled with energy and passion. When I am not  infront of a device I spend my time with family or nature, nothing more soothing than hearing the wind blow between the trees without our modern day noise. I enjoy having a balance towards everything as too much of something is bad. There's no substitute for hardwork. if it's easy then do it easy, if it's hard than do it hard, just get it done because failure is limitations that you set for yourself, so I choose to be limitless and to become undeniable.",
